## Why Locally LocalDoRush?

LocalDoRush is the productivity tool for people who hate productivity tools.

No clutter. No planning overhead. Just **type what you did or will do next** and press **Enter** — the app handles the rest. Every entry is logged, XP is awarded, and you get a sharp, actionable next step from an LLM **you control**.

**The magic:**

* **Game‑like momentum**: visible XP, progress animations, streaks.
* **Privacy by design**: all history, stats, and settings stay on your device.
* **Only one connection**: to the LLM you choose (BYOK OpenAI).
* **Zero busywork**: no grooming lists or shuffling boards.

If you’ve ever dropped a to‑do app because it became a chore, LocalDoRush is the antidote.

## Quick Start (Next.js)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iyiolacak/local-loop.git
cd local-loop
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and paste your **OpenAI API key** into **Settings → LLM**. The app won’t run without it.

## How It Works

1. **Type or speak** your task.
2. **LLM interprets** it and suggests the next step.
3. **Reward engine** logs it, gives XP, animates progress.
4. **Local DB** keeps everything on your device.

* Key is stored locally. You own it.
